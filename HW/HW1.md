### Question 1
Finally got registered in the class and have access to all of the course material.

#### Question 2
I read through chapter 1 and 2, I did not have any questions.

#### Question 3
- The report and order wishes to adpot rules for use of 150 megahertz in the 3550-3700 megahertz (3.5 GHz Band) band.
- The 3.5 GHz band is well suited for mobile broadband small cell technology.
- 3550-3650 MHz is currently being used by the DoD
- Flexible-use geographic licensing, site-based frequency coordination, and unlicensed authorization were all considered for commerical authorization in the new band
- A hybrid was adopted depending on local supply and demand
- If the demand is low a low-cost entry point similar to unlicensed access will be put into place
- If the demand is high, the spectrum will be auctioned off
- The hope is to make the band hospitable to a wide variety of users, deployment models and business cases

#### Current Spectrum Environment
- The 3550-3650 band is allocated to the radiolocation service and the aeronautical radionavigation service on a primary basis for federal use 
- All federal non-military use is on a secondary basis
- Survey operations using transmitters should not exceed 5 watts can be used for secondary basis applications
- 3600-3650 is also allocated to the FSS on a primary basis for non-federal use
- The 3650-3700 band is also allocated for terrestrial non-federal use
- Requires non-exclusive nationwide licenses and registration of individual fixed and base stations.
- Base and fixed stations are limited to 25 watts per 25 MHz.  
- Cannot be placed closer than 150 km to a FSS earth station unless permission is granted

#### Proposed Allocation
- 3550-3600 MHz
    - Federal
        - Radiolocation
        - Aeronautical Radionavigation (ground based)
    - Non-Federal
        - Fixed
        - Mobile except aeronautical mobile
        - Non-federal radiolocation stations that were licensed before the report and order may operate on a secondary basis until the end of the equipment's useful lifetime
        - Non-federal stations in the fixed and mobile except aeronautical mobile services cannot cause interference or claim protection from federal stations in the aeronautical radionavigation and radiolocation services, or airborne radar.
- 3600-3650
    - Federal
        - Radiolocation
        - Aeronautical Radionavigation (ground based)
    - Non-Federal
        - Fixed
        - Fixed-satellite (space to earth)
        - Mobile except aeronautical mobile
        - Earth stations authorized prior to the order (or filed for authorization before the order) may continue to operate on a primary basis.  
        - The assignment of frequencies to new earth stations after the order will be authorized on a secondary basis
- 3650-3700 (non-federal)
    - Fixed
    - Fixed-satellite (space to earth)
    - Mobile except aeronautical mobile
    - The band is also allocated to federal radiolocation service on a primary basis at St. Inigoes, Pascagoula, and Pensacola.  The FCC will coordinate all non-federal operations within 80km of the sites on a case-by-case basis.

In general the whole of the CBRS will be coordinated by one or more authorized SASs.  The CBRS will have two tiers, a Primary Access and a General Authorized access.  General Authorized Access users may operate in the 3550-3700 Mhz band.  Priority Access users may operate in the 3550-3650 Mhz band.  EAch priority access license is authorized to use a 10 MHz channel in the 3550-3650 MHz band.  No more than 7 PALs can be assigned in a given license area at any given time.  Any frequencies that are designated for priority access that are not in use by a priority access licensee may be utilized by general access users. The 3650-3700 band will be reserved for grandfathered wireless broadband licensees and GAA users.


Each license area consists of one census tract. When two or more applications for PALs in a given license area for a specific auction, the commission will make available for assignment one less PAL than the number of PALs in that License Area for which all applicants have applied, up to a maximum of 7.  When there is only one application, the auction will be canceled and the spectrum will remain accessible solely for shared GAA use until the next filing window for competitive bidding of PALs. PAL licensees may aggregate up to 4 PAL channels in any License Area.

GAA users can use PAL frequencies when not in used based on SAS.  Frequencies that are available for GAA will be made available on a shared basis.  All CBSD's must be able to determine their geographic coordinates to an accuracy of +-50 meters horizontal and +-3 meters of elevation and report to SAS at the first time of activation or a power off condition. CBSD must register with and be authorized by an SAS prior to its initial service transmission.

CBSD - fixed stations or networks fo such stations that operate on a PAL or GAA in the Citizens broadband radio servbice.

End User Device (a device authorized and controlled by an authorized cbsd)
 - Maximum EIRP = 23 dBm / 10MHz

Category A (low powered CBSD)
 - Maximum conducted power output = 24 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum EIRP = 30 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum Conducted PSD = 14 dBm/1MHz
 - Cannot have antennas exceeding 6 meters height above average terrain.

 Category B (higher power CBSD) (non-rural)
 - Maximum conducted power output = 24 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum EIRP = 40 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum PSD = 14 dBm/1MHz

 Category B (rural [census tract not located within distance of a town with 20,000 inhabitants or adjacent to a city or town that has 50,000 inhabitants])
 - Maximum conducted power output = 30 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum EIRP = 47 dBm/10MHz
 - Maximum PSD = 20 dBm/1MHz

 RMS power should not exceed -80 dBm in any direction.

 - There is now the concept of PAL protection areas that are calculated by SASs in order to protect PALs from other PALs and GAAs.
 - PAL protection areas are calculated by the census tract bounary and the licensee-defined contour or -96 dBm default contour.
 - PAL channels will be made available for assignment by the SAS for general authorized access use only in areas outside of PAL protection areas.
 - Except in rural areeas, when only one application is accepted, no PAL will be assigned.


 Radio requirements were revised to

 - Category A
     - EIRP 30 dBm/10MHz
     - PSD 20 dBm/1MHz

 - Category B
     - EIRP 47 dBM/10MHz
     - PSD 37 dBM/MHz

#### Question 4

Upper Microwave Flexible Use Licensing

27.5-28.35 GHz
- county sized geographic area licenses (Two 425 MHz licenses by county)

38.6-40 GHz
- partial economic area licensing  (Seven 200 MHz licenses by PEA)
- coprimary federal FSS and MSS allocations limited to military systems

37-38.6
- Limited number of Federal miliatary sites
- 37-37.6 ~ create a space for coordinated co-primary shared access between federal and non-federal users
    - Available for site-based registrations on a coordinated bases with coequal eligible Federal entities.
    - Must register individual base stations and access points prior to placing them in operation.
- Make a significant amount of spectrum available for wireless broadband
- Make band available on a site-psacific coordinated shared basis with eligible Federal entities


64-71 GHz
- Authorize operations based on the rules of the 57-64 GHz band for unlicensed uses such as WiGig and short range devices for interactive motion sensing

Incumbent Operations
- 27.5-29.5 has had long standing allocations for fixed, mobile and FSS allocations.
- The record demonstrates that FSS can share the 28 GHz band with minimal impact.

Reasons
- Millimeter waves haven't been good for mobile in the past but are starting to become after technological changes.
- 5G talks have included various ideas about using Millimeter wave frequencies.



Power limits
- For fixed and base stations operating in connection with mobile systems, the average power of the sum of all antenna elements is limited to EIRP density of +75dBm/100MHz.  For channel bandwidths less than 100 MHz, the EIRP must be reduced propertionally and linearly based on the bandwidth relative to 100 MHz.
- For mobile stations the average power of the sum of all antenna elements is limited to a maximum EIRP of 43 dBm.
- For transportable stations, maximum EIRP of 55 dBm.
- The conductive power and the total radiated power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency block shall be -13 dBm/MHz lower.
- Within the 57-71 GHz band, emission levels shall not exceed 40dBm average and 43 dBm peak.
- For fixed point to point, the average power shall not exceed 82 dBm and shall be reduced by 2dB for every dB that the antenna gain is less than 51 dBi.


### Question 5 (do CH1 Q6)
#### A.
The limit for electric field transmission according to part 15 is at 3 meters, 500 microVolts/m for 1.9 GHz.

P = 0.3E^2 assuming a distance of 3 meters, where P = EIRP in watts and E is the field strength in volts/meter.

Therefore:
P = 0.3(.0005V/m)^2

P = 7.5e-8 watts or -41.25 dBm

#### B.

Link budget is Receiving power = Transmitting power + Gains - Losses

-90 dBm = -41.25 dBm + 0 - Losses
Margin = 48.75 dB.

#### C.

Assuming a free space path model, and the constant of 32.45 for kilometers.

FSPL(dB) = 20log10(d) + 20log10(f) + 32.45

48.75 = 20log10(d) + 20log10(1900) + 32.45
48.75 = 20log10(d) + 20*3.279 + 32.45
48.75 = 20log10(d) + 98.03
-49.28 = 20log10(d)
-2.464 = log10(d)
10 ^ -2.464 = d
d = .00343 Km or 11.2532 feet.

### Question 6 (do CH1 Q7)
#### A.  
At 830 MHz this is part of the 800MHz cellular band.  Because a lot of newer handsets are dual band, it is less likely that the TV will interfere with a cellular handset.  It is possible the TV could interfere with a base station that is operating at 800Mhz if one is nearby.

#### B.  
P = ((.0002V/m)^2) / 377
P = 1.061 e-10 watts/m^2
P = -69.74 dBm/m^2

#### C.
A = (w^2/4p) * G
where w = wavelength
p = pi
G = gain

A = .375 / 4p * 2.1
A = .0625

Pt = P * A
Where A = effective aperture
P = power density
Pt = power (-89 dbm)
P = Pt/A
P = 1.2589e-12/.0625
P = 2.014 e-10 watts/m^2
P = -66.696 dBm/m^2

#### D.

Since the TV (2.014e-10 W/m^2 or -66.696dBm) is outputting a greater power density than the FCC allows (1.061 e-10 W/m^2 or -69.74 dBm), it is not part 15 compliant.
